## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your project, collaborate with others, and manage your codebase efficiently. This repository serves as my learning journal to document the concepts and commands I encounter.

## Getting Started

To get started with Git, you can check out the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-git) for more information.
